Privacy Policy for iLARS
Effective Date: 2025-11-04
Last Updated: 2025-11-04
Controller/Provider: iLARS Team (“we”, “us”, “our”). If you are located in the EU/UK, the data controller is iLARS Team.
Welcome to iLARS, a mobile application designed to help individuals track bowel function and receive educational insights related to life after rectal cancer surgery, including symptoms associated with Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information, in accordance with privacy regulations across the globe, including but not limited to the EU, UK, USA, South Korea, Turkey, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions where iLARS may be used.
 
1. What Data We Collect
We may collect and process the following types of data, exclusively with your explicit consent, and only to the extent necessary to deliver the core features of the application. No personally identifiable information (such as name, email, address, or phone number) is collected at any time. All data is stored under an automatically generated unique user code and remains pseudonymized. Pseudonymization means that your data is stored using a unique identifier instead of directly identifiable personal information (such as your name or email), and it cannot be linked to you without access to additional information that is kept separately and securely. This helps protect your identity and enhances your privacy while still allowing for meaningful use of the data for app functionality and research.
Data categories include:
•	Technical Identifier:
o	Automatically generated unique user code used for session continuity, device linking, and secure symptom tracking. You may also access your symptom data from other devices using the same unique user code. This enables continuity of your records across devices without requiring registration or input of personal identifiers.
•	Health and Symptom-Related Data:
o	Bowel movement frequency and consistency, including structured scales such as the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS)
o	Validated outcome measures, including but not limited to the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) Score and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory (CRADI-8) Score
o	LARS-specific symptoms (urgency, clustering, incontinence, nocturnal leakage, incomplete evacuation)
o	Diet composition, eating patterns, and fiber intake (self-reported or categorized)
o	Fluid intake (estimated or logged in volume)
o	Medications used (categorized or manually entered)
o	Weight, height, BMI, and age (self-entered or estimated)
o	Relevant lifestyle or behavioral factors (e.g., physical activity, stress, sleep quality)
•	App Interaction & Usage Data:
o	Time spent using the app
o	Features accessed (e.g., symptom charts, educational modules)
o	Session frequency and version history
•	Third-Party SDK/Analytics: We avoid tracking that profiles users. If we ever integrate crash/error or performance SDKs, they will be configured not to collect identifiers, and we will list them transparently in this Policy.
This data may be used for personalized app feedback, anonymous research, aggregated analytics, and ongoing improvement of the app functionality, provided your consent remains valid and active.
2. Why We Collect Your Data
We collect and process your data exclusively with your explicit consent and solely for lawful, clearly defined purposes related to the use of the iLARS application. These purposes include:
•	To provide personalized and functional symptom tracking, including the generation of data visualizations, symptom logs, and symptom trend summaries over time
•	To generate non-clinical, educational, AI and current guidelines driven suggestions aimed at supporting users’ self-management of LARS symptoms and related bowel function
•	To conduct anonymized and/or pseudonymized research activities and develop scientific insights that may help improve clinical understanding, care pathways, or quality of life for individuals affected by LARS
•	To refine, enhance, and expand iLARS’s features and functionality over time, including through aggregated usage analytics, user feedback, or technical diagnostics
•	To meet compliance obligations under applicable global data privacy laws and health information regulations
•	To maintain secure and seamless application functionality across devices, sessions, and software updates, using a unique pseudonymized code
•	To ensure quality control, assess performance, and improve the safety and reliability of educational guidance provided in-app
We do NOT collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, or any other directly identifying personal information.
We do NOT sell, license, or share your data with third parties for advertising, marketing, or profiling purposes under any circumstance. We do NOT sell or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes.
Should the App evolve to include optional paid features or subscription-based content, your data will continue to be handled in accordance with the same principles of confidentiality, pseudonymization, and non-commercial research usage. We will not share your data with advertisers or commercial third parties. Any use of your data to support feature improvements—including premium offerings—will be clearly described, and your ongoing consent will be requested where required by law.
3. Legal Basis for Processing (Global Overview)
We process your data in accordance with globally recognized data privacy principles and comply with applicable national and regional privacy legislation. Our legal basis for processing your pseudonymized health-related data is explicit, informed consent, which is obtained prior to any data collection or analysis through clear user agreements.
Where applicable, we also rely on legitimate interest, scientific or research purposes, public health considerations, and compliance with a legal obligation, as permitted by relevant laws.
We comply with the following legal frameworks (among others):
•	European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) / United Kingdom (UK): General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR, including Articles 6(1)(a) and 9(2)(a) for explicit consent regarding sensitive health data
•	United States (USA): While iLARS is not itself a HIPAA-covered entity, we voluntarily adopt HIPAA-aligned safeguards to protect pseudonymized health data. We also comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) regarding consumer rights and transparency.
•	South Korea: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), including localization, consent documentation, and user access rights
•	Turkey: Law on the Protection of Personal Data (KVKK), requiring explicit consent for sensitive health data and transparency in processing practices
•	Russia: Federal Law No. 152-FZ, requiring that personal data of Russian citizens be stored and processed on servers located within the Russian Federation
•	Australia: Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), including obligations for handling health information

Data is handled in a secure and privacy-conscious manner, with safeguards to ensure user confidentiality and to comply with international best practices in digital health ethics and data protection.
4. Your Rights
We respect your rights to data privacy and control, and we are committed to honoring the legal protections granted to individuals under international, national, and regional privacy laws. Depending on your jurisdiction, and subject to the applicable legal framework, you may be entitled to exercise some or all of the following rights regarding your personal or pseudonymized data:
•	Right of Access – You have the right to request access to the data we store and process that is linked to your unique user code, including details about how and why it is being used.
•	Right to Rectification – You may request that we correct, amend, or update any information you believe to be inaccurate or incomplete.
•	Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten) – You have the right to request that we delete your stored data, subject to certain legal or research obligations that may require minimal anonymized retention.
•	Right to Withdraw Consent – You may revoke your consent to data processing at any time. Withdrawing consent will limit your access to app functionality that depends on your data.
•	Right to Data Portability – You may request an export of your data in a commonly used, machine-readable format that can be transferred to another system or retained for personal records.
•	Right to Restriction of Processing – You may request that we temporarily or permanently restrict processing of your data under certain conditions.

5. How We Protect Your Data
We take data security and privacy seriously and implement robust technical, physical, and organizational safeguards to protect all data processed by iLARS. Our approach is aligned with international best practices, including GDPR security principles, HIPAA security standards (where applicable), and ISO/IEC 27001–aligned controls.
Security measures include:
•	End-to-End Encryption – All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3 or higher, securing it against unauthorized interception or access.
•	Encryption at Rest – All data stored on our servers is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 algorithms.
•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Only authorized personnel have access to back-end systems, with permissions based on operational roles and responsibilities.
•	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Administrative accounts require multiple layers of authentication for access.
•	Access Logging & Monitoring – Access to all sensitive systems and services is monitored and logged. Anomalies and unauthorized attempts are flagged and investigated.
•	Pseudonymization – We do not store personally identifiable information; instead, data is stored under a secure, randomly generated user code, reducing the risk of re-identification.
•	Zero Knowledge Policy – We cannot access, see, or recover your symptom data without the user’s code. We do not store passwords, emails, or other identifiers.
•	Hosting Security – We partner only with infrastructure providers that offer HIPAA-eligible, GDPR-compliant, and ISO 27001-certified cloud environments.
•	Internal Security Training & Audits – Our team receives regular data protection training and conducts internal audits to uphold privacy and security commitments.
Despite these measures, no digital system can ever be guaranteed fully secure. Users are encouraged to safeguard their unique user code and report any suspected misuse or breach immediately via our Contact section.
6. Cross-Border Data Transfers
Given the global availability of the iLARS app, your data may be processed in, transferred to, or stored in jurisdictions outside your country of residence, including but not limited to the European Union, United States, South Korea, Turkey, Australia, Russia, New Zealand, and others. These transfers are necessary for the delivery, operation, and support of the app.
To ensure the lawful and secure handling of your data, we implement appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable international data protection laws. These may include:
•	Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) issued by the European Commission or other approved mechanisms to ensure adequate protection when data is transferred internationally
•	Explicit consent for cross-border transfers, where legally required (e.g., Turkey, South Korea)
•	Data localization and residency practices where mandated by law (e.g., Russia – servers located in the Russian Federation for data belonging to Russian citizens). If full compliance with local residency laws is not feasible, iLARS reserves the right to restrict or discontinue availability in certain regions (e.g., Russia).
•	Encrypted storage and pseudonymized identifiers to prevent personal re-identification in transit and at rest
By using iLARS and consenting to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that your data may be transferred to and stored in jurisdictions with different or potentially less stringent privacy protections than your own. We remain committed to upholding high data protection standards globally.
7. Data Retention
We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws and ethical research guidelines.
Retention terms include:
•	Active Use: Your pseudonymized data is retained while your unique user code remains active within the app
•	User-Initiated Deletion: Upon your request for deletion via in-app controls or direct contact, we will permanently erase your user-linked data within a reasonable timeframe unless required to retain a de-identified copy for legally justified reasons
•	Inactive Codes: We may remove data associated with inactive codes after a prolonged period of inactivity, with or without notice, unless it contributes to anonymized research archives
•	Research Use: De-identified or aggregated data used for research or development purposes may be retained indefinitely in a form that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual user
We will not retain pseudonymized or technical identifiers longer than is necessary to provide the app’s core functionality, fulfill legal obligations, or support anonymized scientific research. Any data that is no longer needed is securely destroyed or irreversibly anonymized using best practices.
Your data is retained:
•	As long as your unique code is active
•	Until you request deletion
•	Anonymized data for research may be retained indefinitely
